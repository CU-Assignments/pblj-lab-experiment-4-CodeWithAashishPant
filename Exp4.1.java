Experiment 4.1: Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a simple Java-based application that uses ArrayList to manage employee records. The system allows users to perform the following operations:

Add Employee → Store Employee ID, Name, and Salary.

Update Employee → Modify employee details based on their ID.

Remove Employee → Delete an employee using their ID.

Search Employee → Find employees by ID or Name.

Display All Employees → Show a complete list of employees.
